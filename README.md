### An open letter to the "Prime Minister" (and his enablers)

_Friday 13th December, 2019_

I write this with half an eye on the BBC's turgid election results coverage as a litany of delusion is recited across a dischoate nation. 
I've muted the shit-talkers: it heightens the irony of aeons of evolution producing creatures capable of shaping and transmitting intricate 
pressure waves only to say nothing worth hearing. I've decided to listen to Steven Osborne playing Beethoven's _Hammerklavier_ sonata instead.

(I mention this for two reasons: as a defiant reminder of the many beautiful things you'll never take from us; and because I find it 
amusing to reflect that Beethoven's genius astonishes and inspires two centuries later - whereas you are a mendacious, narcissistic, 
sociopathic herpetic humpsack who'll be burned in effigy for a generation or two and then forgotten.)

It looks like your party - that malignancy of spivs, ideologues, racists, lickspittles and demented finger-jabbers - will receive 
about 45% of the vote and be rewarded with 55% of the seats.

In no meaningful sense can this be considered democratic (even in these semanticidal times). Your claims to a mandate are a bluff. 
Your government is illegitimate.

The Electoral Reform Society was founded in 1884. Without wishing to disparage their efforts and achievements over the last 135 
years, many of us remain effectively disenfranchised. Meanwhile, you flirt with fascism as the world rushes wilfully towards 
environmental catastrophe.

I've therefore founded what might be considered the unofficial (and unarmed) paramilitary wing of the Electoral Reform Society. 

[Naming things is hard|https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html]. For now, "A Life for a Lie" will suffice.

This name does not imply a threat: it is simply an assertion that the lies of you and your cohort - about austerity, immigration,
the European Union, climate change, the risible pretence that you give a trillionth of a fuck about anyone beyond yourself (and maybe 
your donors and immediate social circle); about everything, frankly - have consequences. Your lies are responsible for countless deaths 
and damaged lives. With countless more to come. Unless we stop you. Until we stop you.

We have no command structures or hierarchy, no membership fees or affiliations, no celebrity endorsements, no digital campaign 
managers or social media interns, no donations from hedge funds or Russian gangsters, no friends in the media.

We have no weapons other than hope and empathy. And the knowledge that - for now, at least - we outnumber you.

We didn't start this fight. And we don't want to fight: few of us are confident that we have the courage to face the risks and 
sacrifices that will be required; few of us wish to make enemies of strangers. But we're way past the point where not fighting back becomes 
indistinguishable from complicity and cowardice. And we're close to having nothing left to fight for.

So we will fight.

Know this: we understand that collective self-defence is not only our right; it is also our ethical responsibility. So when our 
children are poisoned by air pollution; when you attempt to neuter the judiciary; when you drive the vulnerable and disabled further 
into destitution and despair; when you destroy the NHS; when you sell weapons to war criminals and invite murderers and rapists to state 
banquets; when you undermine the idea of public service, of a humanity beyond mere cladistics - when you do these things, whenever your 
abuses of power threaten the wellbeing of others, they will be (to quote Frederick Douglass) "resisted with either words, or blows, 
or both".

Please rest assured that we can empathize with your profound insecurities. (We're not the sociopaths. You are.) It's just that given the 
choice between allowing you to affect our lives and, I dunno, sticking forks in your eyes, the common good is pointing forkwards.

We will fight. And we will defeat you - "and all the Caesars to come", as Bill Fay put it - because you have nothing to offer besides 
fear and lies.

We are capable of caring about something other than ourselves. Even you.

Do you still believe that a life for a lie is a price worth paying?
